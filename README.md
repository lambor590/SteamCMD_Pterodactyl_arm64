With this image you can run a SteamCMD server on a Raspberry Pi or other ARM64 device on Pterodactyl Panel.
This image is made for running on Pterodactyl, so you just need to change the image of an egg to this one.


## Usage

```
Change the image of an egg to this one: lambor590/steamcmd_pterodactyl_arm64:latest
```

This image is unfinnished, so it may not work properly.
I'm working to make it as stable as possible.
I will also making a custom SteamCMD installer image for this.
